Hello. Duber Millan.

As I stated in the case title [About Rendezvous LTS Release], 
"I want to know if there will be a new RV LTS release version sooner than 2029."

And, since I received an answer, I will close this Case.
Thank you for your kind response.

Best regards.

Hi,

Please see the below comments from product management - hoping this answers your questions

There is no plan for an LTS release before Feb 2029.  

Monitor this site : https://docs.tibco.com/tibco-lts-releases - Yes, you can receive information about LTS releases here.  We also send out via LBNs from support for any important changes and announcing end of support.

Hi. Duber Millan.

Thank you for your response.
I understand that LTS can be extended and even if extended guarantees one year of extended support.

However, this answer does not address my original question.
My original question was below.
Question => Is there a release plan before February 2029? If there is one, when is it?

If there is no release plan at this point, please answer no.

Additionally, how can I find out about LTS changes or new release information?
Monitor this site : https://docs.tibco.com/tibco-lts-releases
Or else.

Please confirm once again.

Best regards.
KIMI DS.

Hi,

Thank you for your patience - please see below the reply from our product management:

This is the current plan. 
 
Note: LTS can be extended, and if this is the case, then it will be communicated.  If LTS is extended, the same 12 month period will be honoured from the new release date.

TIBCO Support가 문제 해결에 적극적으로 임해 주시기를 바랍니다.
단지 assigned account executive's E-mail을 던져주고 끝내는 것을 원하지 않습니다.
TIBCO Support가 직접 account executive에게 연락을 하고 그 결과를 내게 전해주기를 바랍니다.

Hi. TIBCO Support.

I hope TIBCO Support will actively engage in resolving the issue.
I don't want you to just throw the assigned account executive's email at me and call it a day.
I would like TIBCO Support to contact the account executive directly and relay the results to me.

Subject: About Rendezvous LTS Release
Description:
Hi. 

I have a qustion about Rendezvous LTS release schedule.

https://docs.tibco.com/tibco-lts-releases

According to this page, 8.8.X released February 2025 and support until at least February 2030.

And [Release frequency] - [LTS versions] describes...

"A new LTS version is typically released at least 12 months before the prior LTS release goes out of support."

Then I can expect next LTS version will release at least February 2029.

Question => Is there a release plan before February 2029? If there is one, when is it?

We plan to upgrade the system and would like to know the LTS release schedule in advance.

Best regards.
