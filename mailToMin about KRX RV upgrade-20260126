TIBCO Support가 문제 해결에 적극적으로 임해 주시기를 바랍니다.
단지 assigned account executive's E-mail을 던져주고 끝내는 것을 원하지 않습니다.
TIBCO Support가 직접 account executive에게 연락을 하고 그 결과를 내게 전해주기를 바랍니다.

Hi. TIBCO Support.

I hope TIBCO Support will actively engage in resolving the issue.
I don't want you to just throw the assigned account executive's email at me and call it a day.
I would like TIBCO Support to contact the account executive directly and relay the results to me.

Best regards.
KIMI DS.

Subject: About Rendezvous LTS Release
Description:
Hi. 

I have a qustion about Rendezvous LTS release schedule.

https://docs.tibco.com/tibco-lts-releases

According to this page, 8.8.X released February 2025 and support until at least February 2030.

And [Release frequency] - [LTS versions] describes...

"A new LTS version is typically released at least 12 months before the prior LTS release goes out of support."

Then I can expect next LTS version will release at least February 2029.

Question => Is there a release plan before February 2029? If there is one, when is it?

We plan to upgrade the system and would like to know the LTS release schedule in advance.

Best regards.


Resolution Summary:
You will have to get in touch with your account executive for further details on this.
