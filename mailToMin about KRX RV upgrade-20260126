As KRX is planning an RV upgrade this time, I contacted TIBCO Support regarding the LTS Release and received the following response. 
I am therefore reaching out via email to request your confirmation of the details and a reply.

Subject: About Rendezvous LTS Release
Description:
Hi. 

I have a qustion about Rendezvous LTS release schedule.

https://docs.tibco.com/tibco-lts-releases

According to this page, 8.8.X released February 2025 and support until at least February 2030.

And [Release frequency] - [LTS versions] describes...

"A new LTS version is typically released at least 12 months before the prior LTS release goes out of support."

Then I can expect next LTS version will release at least February 2029.

Question => Is there a release plan before February 2029? If there is one, when is it?

We plan to upgrade the system and would like to know the LTS release schedule in advance.

Best regards.
